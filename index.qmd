# Welcome {.unnumbered}

The three topics for this year's special lectures are:

1. Web scraping and modelling
2. GIS and spatial data
3. Quantitative text analysis

You will find the lecture notes and materials for each topic by clicking on the menu button. These lectures are meant to be more "hands-on" than the previous R1-4 lectures, so be prepared to get your hands dirty with some code!

You may also browse the GitHub repo for the special lecture notes. In particular, you will find `.qmd` files, which you can open in RStudio. Best to clone the repo to your local computers and open the `special-lectures.Rproj` file in RStudio. You will find the source code exactly as it is displayed in the html files. You can also turn on "visual" mode in RStudio to see a friendlier version of the `.qmd` files.
