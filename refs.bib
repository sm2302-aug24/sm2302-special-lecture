  abstract = {Recent advances in computational content analysis have provided scholars promising new ways for estimating party positions. However, existing text-based methods face challenges in producing valid and reliable time-series data. This article proposes a scaling algorithm called WORDFISH to estimate policy positions based on word frequencies in texts. The technique allows researchers to locate parties in one or multiple elections. We demonstrate the algorithm by estimating the positions of German political parties from 1990 to 2005 using word frequencies in party manifestos. The extracted positions reflect changes in the party system more accurately than existing time-series estimates. In addition, the method allows researchers to examine which words are important for placing parties on the left and on the right. We find that words with strong political connotations are the best discriminators between parties. Finally, a series of robustness checks demonstrate that the estimated positions are insensitive to distributional assumptions and document selection.},

  abstract = {We investigate the efficacy of topic model based approaches to two multi-aspect sentiment analysis tasks: multiaspect sentence labeling and multi-aspect rating prediction. For sentence labeling, we propose a weakly-supervised approach that utilizes only minimal prior knowledge---in the form of seed words---to enforce a direct correspondence between topics and aspects. This correspondence is used to label sentences with performance that approaches a fully supervised baseline. For multi-aspect rating prediction, we find that overall ratings can be used in conjunction with our sentence labelings to achieve reasonable performance compared to a fully supervised baseline. When gold-standard aspect-ratings are available, we find that topic model based features can be used to improve unsophisticated supervised baseline performance, in agreement with previous multi-aspect rating prediction work. This improvement is diminished, however, when topic model features are paired with a more competitive supervised baseline---a finding not acknowledged in previous work.},
